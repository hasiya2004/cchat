#A socket is a low-level endpoint for communication between processes on the same or different machines. Sockets provide a flexible and efficient way to implement network applications such as web servers, email servers, file transfer, and online games. In C, the socket API provides a set of functions for creating and managing sockets.

Here are some common functions used in C socket programming:

 1 socket(): creates a new socket and returns a file descriptor that can be used for subsequent communication.

 2 bind(): assigns a local address and port to a socket.

 3 listen(): prepares a socket to accept incoming connections.

 4 accept(): accepts an incoming connection request and returns a new socket file descriptor for communication with the connected client.

 5 connect(): establishes a connection to a remote socket.

 6 send(): sends data to a connected socket.

 7 recv(): receives data from a connected socket.

 8 close(): closes a socket.
 
 
It's important to note that C socket programming requires a good understanding of network protocols, socket types, and address families, among other things. Additionally, error handling is critical in socket programming to ensure that the application behaves correctly and robustly.
